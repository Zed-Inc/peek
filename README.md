# peek
 A small script to take a peek at the first n lines of a file

 usage:

 `peek -f=test.json -l=2`

this will print the first 2 lines of test.json

This script is still a work in progress, eventaully i would like to implement custom
display for different filetypes(csv files can be printed formatted)
